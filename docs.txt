The parser uses a set of rules located in rules.txt
The regexes are checked using full match

The stucture of the symbol table is the one of a binary tree sorted lexicographically
	-it contains internal nodes
	-it has methods for adding and inorder traversal
Because it is unbalanced the following rule applyes:
    if a node is added, the position in the preoder traversal of the other nodes is updated as follows:
      -if its before the new node, the postion stays the same
      -if it is after the new node, the position is incremented by one
